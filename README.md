# Angular JumpStart with TypeScript

The goal of this jumpstart app is to provide
a simple way to get started with Angular 2+ while also showing several key Angular features. The sample
relies on System.js to load TypeScript modules and the required scripts used in the application.

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started. Here are a few
screenshots from the app:

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
